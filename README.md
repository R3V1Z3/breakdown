# BreakDown
BreakDown is an experimental framework for quickly building very specific types of web apps on GitHub Pages; apps that use Markdown and have a heavy emphasis on extending and experimenting using GitHub Gist for code hosting.

## What does it do?
The framework provides:
- a base project that can easily be forked on GitHub.
- custom Markdown rendering function
- easy configuration through URL parameters

## What uses it?
Several projects now use the framework:
- [CHEATScheat](https://ugotsta.github.io/cheats/) - cheatsheet viewer
- [DownSlide](https://ugotsta.github.io/downslide/) - automatic presentations from Markdown documents
- [Entwine](https://ugotsta.github.io/entwine/) - interactive fiction ala Markdown
- [EntwinED](https://ugotsta.github.io/entwined/) - modular text processor and editor for Entwine
- [Emphases](https://ugotsta.github.io/emphases/) - annotation and highlighting app, mainly for Bible references

## GitHub not required
While this framework is built to work on GitHub Pages, it isn't required. This is a client-side JavaScript project that can run on any HTML/JavaScript capable server.
